Commit | Benchmark | Description
a457e24 |  | Add in zbuffering and diffuse shaing. buffer access inside of loop 
959a3be | 222ms - 226ms | Move access to buffer outside of triangle intersect loop
8057a71 | ~235ms | Fix rendering orientation & change from two for loops to single for loop.
LATEST  | ~230ms | Two for loops
UNROLLING the loop only made this slower still. Let the compiler do its work.
STORING actual triangle vertices rather than indices of coordinates made a minimal impact, but did make an impact (1 or 2 ms). Debatable savings. Could go bad for larger scenes
c68059d | ~235ms | Switching to GLM as a vector library. Seems to be slower for now
60f66fe | ~195ms | Intrinsics - Using vector math CPU instructions. Big jump, although, the previous slowdown from glm makes me wonder whether rolling my own could be more beneficial for squeezing out a few ms.


*NOTE: All benchmarks done with default_cube.obj. All benchmarks ignore about
the first second of running. All benchmarks done on fullscreen. Our target is 128ms
