Commit | Benchmark | Description
a457e24 |  | Add in zbuffering and diffuse shaing. buffer access inside of loop 
959a3be | 222ms - 226ms | Move access to buffer outside of triangle intersect loop
8057a71 | ~235ms | Fix rendering orientation & change from two for loops to single for loop.
LATEST  | ~230ms | Two for loops
UNROLLING the loop only made this slower still. Let the compiler do its work.
STORING actual triangle vertices rather than indices of coordinates made a minimal impact, 
        but did make an impact (1 or 2 ms). Some potential savings here.
~ 235ms - Switching to GLM seems to be slower for now
